I am a PhD student at the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

My research interests are in Development Economics, and Applied Econometrics. My current work assesses the impact of the U.S. opioid crisis on drug cartel competition and violence in Mexico, and the relationship between the trade and crime in Mexico's avocado sector.
